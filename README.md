# Dota 2 Performance Analysis

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Dota 2 gameplay performance, utilizing both R and Python for data cleaning, exploration, statistical analysis, and visualization. The project leverages data from the OpenDota API to uncover patterns and insights that can enhance gameplay strategy and understanding.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and cleaned data files.
- `r_analysis/`: Contains R scripts and results.
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
  - `results/`: Output of the R analysis, including figures and tables.
- `python_analysis/`: Contains Python scripts and results.
  - `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and analysis.
  - `results/`: Output of the Python analysis, including figures and tables.

## How to Use
### Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages using `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to either `r_analysis` or `python_analysis` to run the respective analyses.

### R Analysis
See the detailed [R Analysis README](r_analysis/README.md) for instructions on running the R scripts and understanding the results.

### Python Analysis
See the detailed [Python Analysis README](python_analysis/README.md) for instructions on running the Python scripts and understanding the results.

## Key Findings
- Analysis of hero selection and its impact on match outcomes.
- Correlation between performance metrics (kills, deaths, assists, etc.) and game results.
- Economic analysis including net worth and gold per minute.
- Predictive modeling using logistic regression to forecast match outcomes.
